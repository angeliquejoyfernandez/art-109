        <p>My artistic journey serves as an escape from reality. I first started drawing at the age of five, I realized my love and passion for creating art. 
          Back then I would get in trouble for having small doodles on my homework, and now they are a part of my creative process, guiding me towards my next artistic endeavor. 
          My vision when creating art is both about focus and distraction at the same time. By focusing on my art, I continue to create art, and having distractions helps me realize 
          what art I just have made. I’ll just keep going and not know what I am doing sometimes but that is what I call my own process. I expect my audience to know not only the outcome of my art 
          but the emotions as well that are in there. I started with drawing and now gained experience of videographing, editing videos, creating video overlays for media streamers, editing photos, 
          and creating digital art. Art is important to me because it holds the power to transcend boundaries, shows different ways to portray and communicates the ineffable..</p>
