        <p>Art has always been my escape—my way of navigating the world through creativity.

          I first discovered my love for art at the age of five, doodling on my homework despite getting in trouble for it. What once was a childhood habit has now become an integral part of my creative process, guiding me toward new artistic endeavors.
          
          For me, creating art is a delicate balance between focus and distraction. Immersing myself in the process allows ideas to flow naturally, while moments of spontaneity help me see my work from new perspectives. Sometimes, I create without a clear direction, embracing the uncertainty as part of my unique process.
          
          Beyond drawing, I have expanded my skills into videography, video editing, digital overlays for media streamers, photo editing, and digital art. My work is not just about the final outcome—it's about conveying emotion and meaning, allowing my audience to connect with the stories within my art.
          
          Art, to me, is more than a form of expression; it is a universal language—one that transcends boundaries, challenges perceptions, and communicates the ineffable.</p>
